# Overview

**RoboCasa** is a large-scale simulation framework for training generally capable robots to perform everyday tasks. Four pillars underlie RoboCasa:
- **Diverse assets**, including 120 kitchen scenes and over 2,500 3D objects, created with the aid of generative AI tools
- **Cross-embodiment support** for mobile manipulators and humanoid robots
- **Diverse tasks** created with the guidance of large language models
- **High-quality human demonstrations** in addition to **massive robot datasets** created with automated trajectory tools
