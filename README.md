This is the official codebase of RoboCasa, a large-scale simulation framework for training generally capable robots to perform everyday tasks. This guide contains information about installation and setup. Please refer to the following resources for additional information:

## Latest updates
* [10/31/2024] **v0.2**: using RoboSuite `v1.5` as the backend, with improved support for custom robot composition, composite controllers, more teleoperation devices, photo-realistic rendering.

-------
## Installation
RoboCasa works across all major computing platforms. The easiest way to set up is through the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) package management system. Follow the instructions below to install:
1. Set up conda environment:

   ```sh
   conda create -c conda-forge -n robocasa python=3.10
   ```
2. Activate conda environment:
   ```sh
   conda activate robocasa
   ```
3. Clone and setup robosuite dependency (**important: use the master branch!**):

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite
   cd robosuite
   pip install -e .
   ```
4. Clone and setup this repo:

   ```sh
   cd ..
   git clone https://github.com/robocasa/robocasa
   cd robocasa
   pip install -e .
   pip install pre-commit; pre-commit install           # Optional: set up code formatter.

   (optional: if running into issues with numba/numpy, run: conda install -c numba numba=0.56.4 -y)
   ```
5. Install the package and download assets:
   ```sh
   python robocasa/scripts/download_kitchen_assets.py   # Caution: Assets to be downloaded are around 5GB.
   python robocasa/scripts/setup_macros.py              # Set up system variables.
   ```

-------
## Quick start
**(Mac users: for these scripts, prepend the "python" command with "mj": `mjpython ...`)**

### Explore kitchen layouts and styles
Explore kitchen layouts (G-shaped, U-shaped, etc) and kitchen styles (mediterranean, industrial, etc):
```
python -m robocasa.demos.demo_kitchen_scenes
```

### Play back sample demonstrations of tasks
Select a task and play back a sample demonstration for the selected task:
```
python -m robocasa.demos.demo_tasks
```

### Explore library of 2500+ objects
View and interact with both human-designed and AI-generated objects:
```
python -m robocasa.demos.demo_objects
```
Note: by default this demo shows objaverse objects. To view AI-generated objects, add the flag `--obj_types aigen`.

### Teleoperate the robot
Control the robot directly, either through a keyboard controller or spacemouse. This script renders the robot semi-translucent in order to minimize occlusions and enable better visibility.
```
python -m robocasa.demos.demo_teleop
```
Note: If using spacemouse: you may need to modify the product ID to your appropriate model, setting `SPACEMOUSE_PRODUCT_ID` in `robocasa/macros_private.py`.
